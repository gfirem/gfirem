Add a set of extra fields to formidable to improve your work

== Description ==
---
You are using Formidable and would like to skyrocket your forms? Forms are the tool that turns an anonymous visitor into a 'known person' - a person that interacted with your landing or sales page. You give or promise value to them and get more specific information from them in return, through forms.
---
It's a needed exchange for every market place. With this plugin extension you can find out more about your site visitors once he or she added more information into your form. Depending on what information you will need from them you have a couple of new field options to customize your form.
---
Turn your site visitors IP addresses into people you 'know'. There are 3 levels that enables you to improve the process creating simple or advanced forms:

### FREE LEVEL FIELDS
 * User List – shows a drop-down with a list of users belong to a role (admin, subscriber, etc).
 * Signature - a pad that drafts a signature and saves it as an image. It’s possible to edit the signature and changing it’s colors.

### STARTER VERSION FIELDS
 * *Free Version PLUS*
 * Select Image - simply select an image from WP Media Library or upload it from your own files to the WP Media Library which enables you to edit or delete images. Also you are able to zoom into the image preview.
 * Switch Button – your user needs a binary option? It works just like a on-off switch.

### PRO VERSION FIELDS
 * *Starter Version PLUS*
 * DateTimePicker - you can either pick a date or a time or both and set the format and language.
 * Autocomplete - already saved data from other forms can be applied and combined with other fields of the same kind to create cascade filters from different forms data.
 * Roles List - Show list of roles which you can select from the frontend. It integrates with the Formidable registration.
 * All tweaks

### TWEAKS FOR PRO
 * Filter Dynamic/Lookup field entries, with an option to bypass for admin.
 * Filter Dynamic field for unique values.
 * Zoom to preview image in the upload field.
 * Show only the image belong to the current user in the media uploader, this is global for WP, but is related to Select Image field.
 * Upload tab as default when using the Select Image field.
 * Tweak the Page Break, to add a "Save Now" option inside it.
